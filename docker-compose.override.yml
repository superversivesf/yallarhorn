# It overrides/extends the base docker-compose.yml configuration

# No volume overrides - use named volumes from base config
# Change to bind mounts below if you prefer local file access for development

# To use local bind mounts instead of named volumes, uncomment:

#     driver: local
#     driver_opts:
#       type: none
#       device: ./data
